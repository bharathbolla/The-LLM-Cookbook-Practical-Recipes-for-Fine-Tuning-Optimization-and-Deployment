How many cakes do they have now?\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n1. The bakery started with 20 cakes.\n2. They sold 15 cakes, so they have 20 - 15 = 5 cakes left.\n3. They baked 8 more cakes, so they now have 5 + 8 = 13 cakes.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 13\n\n\n\nQuestion: John has 5 apples. He buys 3 more boxes of apples, and each box contains 4 apples. How many apples does John have in total?\n\nAnswer: Let's think step by step.\n\n\nGenerated Response (Few-Shot CoT):\n1. John started with 5 apples.\n2. He bought 3 more boxes of apples, so he now has 5 + 3 = 8 apples.\n3. Each box contains 4 apples, so John now has 8 ÷ 4 = 2 apples in each box.\nFinal Answer: John has 5 + 8 = 13 apples in total.\n",
